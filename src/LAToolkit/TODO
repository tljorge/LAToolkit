    1c. Clear button
  
    

2) Text processor -> matrix objects
    2a. Working for 1 matrix no operations supported, needs to handle 2+
    2b. Get operations supported

3) More matrix operations
    3a. Gaussian elimination

4) Fix any bugs
    4a. Need to make matrix operations that require 2 matrices be able to
